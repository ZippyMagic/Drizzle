## What is Drizzle?
Drizzle is an open-source, powerful tool for your website to help optimize loading and reduce lag.

It does this by loading code externally through javascript, decreasing lag and increasing performance. Drizzle automatically logs website crashes and sends it to the email address coded into the website HTML.

## How do I install this?
To install Drizzle, first add
```
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZippyMagic/Drizzle/master/src/external/loader/drizzle.min.js"></script>
```
to your website. Then, add in the code, as shown in the example below:
